  'The Hop JS Client SDK allows you to interact with Hop products from your
  frontend application.'

## Installation

The JS Client SDK is hosted on NPM under `@onehop/client`.

#### npm

```bash
npm i @onehop/client
```

#### Yarn

```bash
yarn add @onehop/client
```

## Initializing the SDK

Find your project ID on [this page](https://console.hop.io/project/settings).

```jsx JSX
import {hop} from '@onehop/client';

// hop.init should be called as early as possible in your application's lifecycle

hop.init({
	projectId: 'project_xxx', // replace with your project ID
});
```

## Subscribing to a unprotected channel

Unprotected channels allow anyone to connect as long as they know the channel id. You can learn more about types of channels on [this page](https://react.dev/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs).

```jsx
import { hop } from '@onehop/client';

const instance = await hop.init({ projectId: '' });
const initialChannelState = instance.subscribeToChannel('HopIsReallyCool');

instance.on('STATE_UPDATE', (data) => {
  console.log(`Look at all those chickens: ${data}`);
});
```

## Send a message to a channel

```jsx
import { hop } from '@onehop/client';

const instance = await hop.init({ projectId: '', token: '' });

instance.sendMessage('votes', 'add', 1);
instance.sendMessage('public-chat', 'kashcafe', { user: 'Kashall', message: 'This is a message!' });
```
